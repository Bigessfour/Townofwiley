# Copilot Instructions

## Angular MCP Required

- For any Angular-specific task in this repository, use the Angular CLI MCP server before falling back to generic web knowledge or ad-hoc Angular guidance.
- Treat Angular CLI MCP as mandatory for Angular documentation lookup, best-practice guidance, Angular examples, workspace inspection, and Angular-aware test or build actions when the MCP tools are available.
- Prefer Angular MCP tools for Angular questions such as APIs, control flow, standalone patterns, signals, DI, routing, forms, HTTP, testing, and modernization guidance.
- Prefer Angular MCP workspace-aware tools before making Angular code changes when they can answer the question or validate the change.
- If Angular CLI MCP is unavailable, failing, or missing from the host environment, say that explicitly and then continue with the best available fallback.

## Angular MCP Priorities

- Use Angular MCP documentation and best-practice tools before external searches for Angular framework guidance.
- Use Angular MCP example and project inspection tools before inventing Angular patterns.
- Use Angular MCP test, build, devserver, or e2e tools when they are available through the connected host instead of bypassing them.

## Repository Context

- This is an Angular workspace and Angular-specific recommendations should align with current Angular documentation and CLI-supported practices.
- Keep Angular solutions consistent with standalone components, modern Angular syntax, and current Angular guidance whenever Angular CLI MCP confirms that approach.

## Terminal Policy

- This workspace allows `curl.exe` and `Invoke-WebRequest` for HTTP operations, including diagnostics, API calls, and data retrieval from live sites, AWS, or health endpoints.
- HTTP commands that send a body or use mutating methods such as `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` should still require confirmation.
- When direct shell web utilities are blocked by host policy, prefer Python `urllib` or .NET `HttpClient` as the fallback for the same diagnostic purpose.
